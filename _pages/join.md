  <h2>Join the Lab</h2>
  <p>
We are looking for highly motivated PhD students excited to work at the intersection of machine learning, computer architecture, and high-performance systems.
If you’re passionate about leveraging machine learning to optimize architectural design, improve compiler optimizations, and build intelligent performance-aware systems, we would love to hear from you. Our research focuses on applying ML to real system-level challenges — including learned performance models, machine learning-driven compiler optimization, accelerator efficiency, and architecture–ML co-design.
